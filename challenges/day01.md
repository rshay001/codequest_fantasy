# Day 01 â€” The Wizard's Counting Spell ðŸª„

You meet a friendly wizard who gives you a short list of numbers. Sum them to prove your arithmetic skills.

**Input:** A list of integers, one per line.
**Goal:** Output the sum of the numbers.

**Example Input:**

Write a program that reads integers from input (one per line) until the end of input, then outputs their sum.

**Hints for beginners:**
