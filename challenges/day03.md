#Day 3 - The Cursed Door

The runes shimmer, but the door does not open.
Link looks again at the pedestal — he realized he didn't finish reading. The final line reads:
<blockquote>
If the total number of symbols is odd, the spell is cursed.<br>
Cursed lines weaken the door — their values must be subtracted.</blockquote>

For example:
<blockquote>
Line 1: #*# has 2 red (#) and 1 blue (*): 2 × 1 = 2. Since 2+1=3 (odd), this is -2 <br>
Line 2: ***## has 2 red (#) and 3 blue (*): 2 × 3 = 6. Since 2+3=5 (odd), this is -6 <br>
Line 3: #*#*#* has 3 red (#) and 3 blue (*): 3 × 3 = 9. Since 3+3=6 (even), this is +9 <br>
</blockquote>

Now Link must recalculate the true key number, subtracting the cursed attempts and adding the pure ones.
What is the real number that opens the door?
