#Day 3 - Oops, which unit now?

Detective Yolo realized there's no such apartment number on the floor, so he read the card again. Then he realized he didn't finish the instructions. The last line reads:
If the number of symbols is an odd number, the subtotal is negative.

For example:
```
Line 1: #*# has 2 red (#) and 1 blue (*): 2 × 1 = 2. Since 2+1=3 (odd), this is -2
Line 2: ***## has 2 red (#) and 3 blue (*): 2 × 3 = 6. Since 2+3=5 (odd), this is -6
Line 3: #*#*#* has 3 red (#) and 3 blue (*): 3 × 3 = 9. Since 3+3=6 (even), this is +9
```
Now he's gotta recompute it! What's the real apartment number?
